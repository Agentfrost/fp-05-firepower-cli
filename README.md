# eStreamer eNcore
The Cisco eStreamer client. 

The Cisco Event Streamer (also known as eStreamer) allows you to stream System intrusion,
discovery, and connection data from Firepower Management Center or managed device (also
referred to as the eStreamer server) to external client applications.

eStreamer responds to client requests with terse, compact, binary encoded messages â€“ this
keeps it fast.

eNcore is a new all-purpose client which requests all possible events from eStreamer, parses
the binary content and outputs events in various formats to support other SIEMs.

# Support
This is a beta version of eNcore. Before the General Availability release this will be
updated with details of paying for and receiving support.

# Python3

The 4.x branches of this project correspond to Python3 support, files use the future library as well as python3 executable, you may have to import the python3 equivalent of pip for openssl support

# Quick install
* Run eNcore: `./encore.sh`
* Run a connectivity test: `./encore.sh test` (and enter the pkcs12 password)
* View the log output `tail -f estreamer.log`
* `./encore.sh foreground` - run in the foreground
* `./encore.sh start` - starts a background task
* `./encore.sh stop` - this will stop the background task
* `./encore.sh restart` - this will restart the background task
